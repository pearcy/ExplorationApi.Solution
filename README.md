## User Stories

As a user, I want to GET and POST reviews about travel destinations.
As a user, I want to GET reviews by country or city.
As a user, I want to see the most popular travel destinations by number of reviews or by overall rating.
As a user, I want to PUT and DELETE reviews, but only if I wrote them. (Start by requiring a user_name param to match the user_name of the author on the message. You can always try authentication later.)
As a user, I want to look up random destinations just for fun.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

There are multiple ways to query the API. To search by username or a specific rating(1-5), add the parameter(s) after `places?` like so: `http://localhost:5000/api/places?username=kate&rating=5`. Use an ampersand(&) to separate parameters.



To search by page and/or to limit the number of results per page, add `pages?` after `places/`, then specity the pageNumber (which page you would like to see) and pageSize (how many results you would like per page. Here is an example query:  `http://localhost:5000/api/places/pages?pageNumber=2&pageSize=8`. If pageSize is not specified, the default number of results per page is 10.
